## Mathematical Competition in Modeling (MCM) - Opiod Epidemic
This was the first data analysis project I worked, as part of the MCM 2019.
After a regression analysis of the data, our team concluded with a number of possibilites of what was correlated to significant increases in opioid-related arrests.
We concluded that one possibility was an increase in interactions with the healthcare system (nurses, doctors, clinics, etc.) was correlated with an increase in opioid arrests by county.
Our reasoning for this was these interactions increase your chance of being prescribed a opioid, and hence acted as points of introduction for the addiction.

Another trend we saw in the data was counties high in indicators of socio-economic resources often saw an increase in opioid arrests, indicating that while better investment in these counties by state and federal governments likely would help, opioid trends did follow closely to these factors.
Counter-intuitive to what was assumed by our team.
